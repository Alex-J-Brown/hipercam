This is a directory of one-off scripts that, with some editing
perhaps, might be useful as the start of developing other
scripts. Basically a storehouse of potentially useful stuff that may
save on future effofrt. Any which are really useful and often needed
may be worked up and generalised to become part of the official
pipeline.

extinction.py  -- computation of extinction from a HiPERCAM log file.
fringe-runs.py -- searches database file for potential fringe map runs.
pfind.py       -- searches for periodic signals, fits amplitude of highest.
