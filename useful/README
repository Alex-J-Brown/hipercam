This is a directory of one-off scripts that, with some editing
perhaps, might be useful as the start of developing other
scripts. Basically a storehouse of potentially useful stuff that may
save on future effofrt.

extinction.py  -- computation of extinction from a HiPERCAM log file.
fringe-runs.py -- digs out runs of potential use for fringe maps.
pfind.py       -- searches for periodic signals, fits amplitude of highest.
