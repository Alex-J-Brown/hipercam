|hiper| pipeline news
*********************

This page documents important changes in the pipeline, as a help to
whether you should update. I have revised how I list updates here and
from now on intend just to add new items when the first or second
number in the version changes, hence I have scrubbed old items (full
lists of past changes can be seen on github in any case). NB the
version of these docs may reflect a development version subsequent to
the most recent release and hence will appear to be one click on.
