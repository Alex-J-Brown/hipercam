Installing the software
=======================

The HiPERCAM pipeline is written in Python, specifically Python 3.X. The code
is stored on github and can be downloaded with::

    git clone https://github.com/HiPERCAM/hipercam.git

This will create a sub-directory called 'hipercam' wherever you run it. You
should move into that sub-directory where you will find a file README.rst
with further instructions and repeated verbatim below:

.. literalinclude:: ../README.rst
   :language: none
