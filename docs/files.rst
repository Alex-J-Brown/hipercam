Useful files
************

This page documents some files that may come in useful while observing or
during reduction.

CCD defects
===========

The |hiper| CCDs have a number of defects, dust and the like, and, as
of 13 May 2021, a hair in the upper-right quadrant of CCD 2 along with
a long-standing similar feature in the lower-left quadrant of
CCD 4. When acquiring targets these may not be visible so you are
**very strongly advised** to over plot defects. You can also create
your own using the pipeline command |setdefect| and you are encouraged
to do so if you see a defect not already marked in whatever file you
use.

Defects are classified as "moderate" (plotted in yellow) or "severe"
(red). What one counts as one or the other is a matter of taste. If you are
too picky, you could end up with so many defects that you are afraid to
observe.

I have decided to define defects according to the following
prescription: ``moderate``: 10 to 25% deviation from the norm;
``severe``: greater than 25% from the norm. I mark each pixel in these
categories, so a really bad feature might appear in multiple pixels
(there is a very nasty feature in the lower-left quadrant of |hiper|'s
CCD 4 for example). I plan to update the file with time, and retain
old ones for monitoring purposes.  I identified the bad pixels using a
flat field divided by a smoothed version of itself (smoothed with a 40
pixel FWHM 2D gaussian filter).

When observing, you should move the target and essential comparison
stars away from any such defects, particularly those that appear in
red. The zoom/pan feature of |nrtplot| is useful for this.

  #. 2021-05-13 (:download:`HiPERCAM defect file
     <hipercam_defects_2021_05_13.dft>`) New hair in
     upper-right of CCD 4.

  #. 2018-05-21 (:download:`HiPERCAM defect file
     <hipercam_defects_2018_05_21.dft>`)

  #. 2018-06-02 (:download:`ULTRACAM defect file
     <ultracam_defects_2018_06_02.dft>`)

  #. 2018-06-21 (:download:`ULTRACAM defect file
     <ultracam_defects_2018_06_21.dft>`) Added another bad column in CCD 2

  #. 2019-12-08 (:download:`ULTRASPEC defect file
     <ultraspec_defects_2019_12_08.dft>`)

.. Warning::
   For ULTRACAM I need also to add hot pixel defects which need to be regarded
   differently to flat field and poor charge transfer defects as a poor hot
   pixel could be very bad for a faint target but not matter much for a bright
   one.

.. _fringing_files:

Fringe maps and peak/trough pairs
=================================

Two types of files are needed to implement defringing.  Fringe maps as
generated by |makefringe| (these are otherwise standard hcm files),
and sets of peak/trough pairs as generated by |setfringe| with
extension ".frng". Here are some pre-prepared examples to get you
going.

  #. 2019-05-19, HiPERCAM fringe map. Created from runs 0018 to 0025
     from the night of 2018-05-19 on the GTC, with one frame of 0019
     removed because of a satellite trail. 71x120 sec dithered images
     in all. Smoothed with FWHM=4. (:download:`hipercam z-band fringe
     map <hipercam_fmap_2019_05_19.hcm>`)

  #. 2018-04-15, HiPERCAM fringe map. Created from runs 0035 to 0043
     from the night of 2018-04-15 on the GTC, with one frame of 0038
     removed because of a satellite trail. 71x120 sec dithered images
     in all. Smoothed with FWHM=4. (:download:`hipercam z-band fringe
     map <hipercam_fmap_2018_04_15.hcm>`)

  #. 2018-04-15, associated peak/troughs. Not necessarily definitive but
     a start. (:download:`hipercam z-band peak/trough pairs
     <hipercam_fpair_2018_04_15.frng>`)
