Observer's guide
================

The HiPERCAM pipeline allows observers to look at their data as it comes in
and to reduce it in near "real time". It is downstream of the data acquisition
system and has no direct effect upon it. At the telescope its most important
role is to allow you to assess the data as it comes in.
