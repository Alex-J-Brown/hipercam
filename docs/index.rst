The HiPERCAM pipeline manual
****************************

The HiPERCAM pipeline serves two purposes. First, it provides a means of
displaying, analysing and reducing HiPERCAM data. Second, it provides an
"Application Programmers Interface" (API) to allow you to access and
manipulate HiPERCAM and related data. The first will be of interest to anyone
using HiPERCAM; the second to those who want to code their own scripts.  This
manual covers both aspects.
