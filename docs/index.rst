Welcome to the HiPERCAM pipeline manual
***************************************

The HiPERCAM pipeline serves two purposes. First, it provides a means of
displaying, analysing and reducing HiPERCAM data (and it can be adapted
to work with multi-CCD imaging data in general. Second, it provides an
"Application  Programmers Interface" (API) to allow you to access and
manipulate HiPRECAM and related data. The first will be of interest to anyone
using HiPERCAM; the second to those who want to code their own scripts.
This manual covers both aspects.
