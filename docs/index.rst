The |hiper| pipeline manual
****************************

The |hiper| reduction software, known as the "pipeline" for short, serves two
purposes. First, it provides a means of displaying, analysing and reducing
|hiper| data. Second, it provides an "Application Programmers Interface" (API)
to allow you to access and manipulate |hiper| and related data. The first will
be of interest to anyone using |hiper|; the second to those who want to code
their own scripts.  This manual covers both aspects. It does not cover use of
the |hiper| GUI or the finding chart generator, hfinder. Details of these
may be found on ``gitub <https://github.com/HiPERCAM>``.

   These pages are under development and incomplete. We have not had enough
   time on sky to shake the system down and there are sure to be many teething
   problems. Apologies!
