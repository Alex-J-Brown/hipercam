The |hiper| pipeline manual
****************************

The |hiper| pipeline serves two purposes. First, it provides a means of
displaying, analysing and reducing |hiper| data. Second, it provides an
"Application Programmers Interface" (API) to allow you to access and
manipulate |hiper| and related data. The first will be of interest to anyone
using |hiper|; the second to those who want to code their own scripts.  This
manual covers both aspects.
