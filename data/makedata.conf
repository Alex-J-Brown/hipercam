# CCD section
#
# Section titles must specify a label for the CCD, e.g. [ccd 1] will
# lead to a label '1' for the CCD. Then lots of parameters per CCD.  angle,
# scale, xoff, yoff, flscale are all applied to whatever targets are added to
# provide variation. In this first case, the CCD acts as the reference so they
# take default values.
#
# Parameters:
#
# nxtot = maximum X-dimension, unbinned pixels [int]
# nytot = maximum Y-dimension, unbinned pixels [int]
# xcen = offset of centre of rotation of CCD from (1+nxtot)/2
# ycen = offset of centre of rotation of CCD from (1+nytot)/2
# angle = anti-clockwise rotation of field around centre, degrees [float]
# scale = the field will be expanded by this factor [float]
# xoff = X offset to apply to targets for this CCD, unbinned pixels [float]
# yoff = Y offset to apply to targets for this CCD, unbinned pixels [float]
# fscale = factor to scale the target fluxes by [float]
# toff = time offset to apply, seconds [float]
