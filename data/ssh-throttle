Following is a fancy command for opening up a bandwidth-limited ssh tunnel
for testing. The ip address may need changing.

   ssh -o "ProxyCommand pv -q -L 32k | nc %h %p" -L5900:localhost:5900 phsaap@137.205.62.205

The procedure for testing is then

1) Issue command 

   x11vnc -shared -many -display :0

   on the laptop.

2) Check ip with /sbin/ifconfig

3) Issue ssh command as above on desktop

4) Get Downloads/VNC-Viewer-6.18.907-Linux-x64 going on desktop

5) Start trying hipercam pipeline on laptop from desktop.
